The plaintiffs ’ case is that, the Sho p had been continuously affect ed by the water seepage problem s over the years from 2010 to 2017 . They are not confined to the periods stated in the nuisance notices only. The plaintiffs say the history of the seepage has clearly shown that the 1st floor was the source of the leakage as repeated nuisance notices had been issued against the defendant , targeted against different areas on the 1st floor. The plaintiffs further say that, given the history of the water leakage, the number of complaints and the number of nuisance notices received by them , the defendant ought to have engaged a competent contractor to make a complete overhaul of the drainage system on the 1st floor. Hence, the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had neglected in maintaining the 1st floor and left it in a state of disrepair. Such neglect , according to the plaintiffs, has caused distress, discomfort and inconvenience to the plaintiffs over a period of 8 years | (c) If the defendant neither knows and intends harm nor is negligent with regard to the consequences of his conduct, then he may be nevertheless liable if the claimant can bring his case within the rule in Rylands v Fletcher , and in that event there is strict liability.

If the court does not think the matter to be clearly beyond doubt or is not satisfied that there is no reasonable cause of action or that the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, then, there should be no striking out: The New China Hong Kong Group Ltd. & Anor v Ng Kwai Kai Kenneth HCA 519/2010, 11 February 2011, at §40 | In the present case, although there is a general reference to intellectual property right, there is no plea that the Plaintiff owns any registered trade mark or design. Nor does the Plaintiff rely on passing off as a separate cause of action | V 8. In the present case, one can get no hint from the Statement of Claim as to why it is claimed that the title “White Party” is a work originated from the Plaintiff. For this reason alone one can say that the Plaintiff’s claim does not start to take shape as a copyright claim. Furthermore, it is clear law that generally there is no copyright in titles or names (see for instances Dicks v Yates (1881) 18 Ch.D. 76; Francis Day and Hunter v Twentieth Century Fox Ltd. [1940] AC 112; Rose v Information Services Lt d. [1987] FSR 254; Griggs Group Ltd. v Evans [2004] FSR 31). Hence, in so far as the Plaintiff contends that copyright subsists in the name “White Party”, such contention is clearly misconceived",

On 1 May 2006, after checking with the factory, the defendant told th e plaintiff that the fabric which had already been purchased by the factory was not enough to make the extra pieces since the factory had only purchased 3% extra fabric.

He at the same time called Christine Yuen and informed her that if the order was to be cancelled, the factory would not return the deposit. Christine Yuen said she would look in to the matter to see how to have the matter fixed. With the hope that Christine Yuen would fix the matter, the defendant continued the sampling. 18 July 2006, Mary informed Tommass that the Pants would need 28 days to leave vessel port in China .

    "case_type": "Most of the background facts are evidenced by docum ents and a summary is provided as follows. The parties’ first commercial contact started in October 2010. Attached to an email of Madam Deborah Yeung (“ Yeung ”), director of In terfid, to Mr Alvin Yeung (“Alvin ”), sales manager of Porton dated 28 October 201 0 was a document entitled “Quotation” (“ October Quotation ”). Yeung signed t he document with a chop of Interfid for confirmation . The October Quotation involved 3 different products . This action does not concern any transactions relating to the October Quot ation . 3. On 22 November 2010, at 11:27 a.m., Alvin sent to Yeung an email attached thereto a document containing quotation prices. Alvin asked Yeung to sign on the same to confirm the details. 4. On the same day, at 12:09 a.m., by way of an attachment to her email to Alvin, Yeung returned the document with her signature appended thereon. Again, it was stamped with the chop of Interfid. The document is entitled “ Quotation & Confirmation ” dated 22 November 2012 (“ November Q & C ”). 5. The November Q & C concerned two products. They were silver hang tags and green hang tags. It is common ground that Interfid merely placed orders for green hang tags and not silver hang tags pursuant to the November Q & C . Porton’s claim involves the green hang tags only in sofar as the November Q & C is concerned | Porton kept a running account for Interfid (“the Account ”). Interfid from time to time made payments by cheques without specifying to which invoices such cheques were related. Each of such payment s of Interfid would first settle the earliest indebtedness. 13. In respect of the goods sold and delivered under the October Q & C and the March Q & C, Interfid paid Po rton a ltogether a total sum of HK$458,800 . The outstanding balance in the Account stood at HK$406,000 as at November 2011. This is th e sum (with interest th ereon) Chau now claims. Plaintiff’s case 14. Porton’s case is simple and straightforward. It relies on the express terms of the October Q & C and the March Q & C. There is no dispute that P orton did delive r to Interfid 50,000 green hang tags | with Porton . In another breath, h owever, Interfid asserts that it repeatedly complained to Porton about the prices stated in such Invoices upon receipt of the same. 20. Therefore, Interfid claims that it has overpaid Porton in the total sum of HK$157,520, which forms the subject matter of its counterclaim. 21. In answer to Porton’s Request for Further and Better Particulars of the De fence and Counterclaim, Interfid avers that the Alvin orally agreed the price for the green hang tags to be HK$480/k folds two weeks before the dates of the 1st and 2nd Invoices and the price for the new hang tags to be HK$520/k folds two weeks before the 3rd Invoices | Before: His Honour Judge Kent Yee in C ourt Dates of Hearing: 18 – 19 February 2013 Date of Judgment : 26 April 2013   J U D G M E N T",

Induced by those emails and under the impression that those emails were from the co - president, the staff acceded to the request and made the transfer (“the transfer”). 5.

Under the Rules of the District Court , the latest d ay on which t he plainti ff could have accept ed the sanctioned payment without requiring leave of the court was 31 May 2012. 5. Order 22, rule 23(5) provides that the court shall make the orders on costs referred to in Order 22, rule 23(2), (3) and (4) unless the court considers it unjust to do so. 6. Having considered the submissions by Mr Liu Chin -yu, counsel for the plaintiff, I am not satisfied that it would be unjust to make the orders sought under paragraph 1(a) and (b) of th e summons. 7. The defendant made the sanction ed payment shortly after t he plaintiff had commenced the action. The sanction ed payment was made before the close of pleadings. 8.

Such an incentive would be deprived of effect unless the non -acceptance of an offer which subsequently proves to have been a sufficient offer ordinarily will advantage the defendant in the respect set out in the rules. 10.

And it is apparent that the plaintiff had not deliberately cho sen to commence the action in the District Court in the hope of getting an exaggerated award. I reject the submission that costs should be assessed at SCT scale | “the pronouncement by HH SP Yip DJDC was not enshrined in an Order. However, the defendant respectfully submits and understands that it would be normal court practice for a trial judge to liaise with his predecessor(s) concerning such matters generally, especially following any relevant notations upon the Court file. This is made the more and necessary in the interests of justice in circumstances where the Judge, having made a ‘pronouncement’, thereafter ordered that there be redaction of evidence, to the considerable p rejudice of the defendant , and in circumsta nces where the pronouncement as to costs was made at the same time, but in the interests of the defendant in its case as to costs against the plaintiff . The role of the Court is to facilitate the Underlying Objectives per O 1A, r 1, 2 and 4 RDC. Patently , taking due judicial heed of case management pronouncements and decisions is necessary to ensure that there is a sense of reasonable proportion and procedural economy in the continuity and conduct of proceedings and, above all, to ensure fairness between the parties thus to achieve the ends of justice in the Court’s consideration of such matters.” | I now deal with the submission that costs should somehow be reduced or apportioned in light of the fact that the final award was much less than that claimed in the Statement of Claim and the plaintiff lost on the important issue of quantification of its claim | There is one more significa nt and undisputed fact that I should mention. The defendant incessantly hammers the point that the final award was a mere HK$27,780 and the plaintiff amended its claim to plead unjust enrichment during the course of the trial. At the final stage of the c ase and in the submissions on costs filed, it was repeatedly said that the case could have been settled long ago if the plaintiff had pleaded its case properly and be more circumspect in its claim.

Chu ’s acts obstructed the use of the Car Park Space No 7 (“ CPS No 7 ”) and caused annoyance and nuisance to other owners. The Owners Incorporation therefore decid ed to authorize the Manager to commence legal action against Chu. Consequently , DCCJ 3373/08 w as commenced in 2008 .

A B C D | In an application for default judgment under Order 19 rule 7 of the RHC, the court would give judgment according to the pleadings alone, so it is not necessary for the plaintiff to prove the case by evidence.5 But Order 19 rule 7 of the RHC is not mandatory but discretionary, and the court retains its discretionary power whether to give judgment or to extend a party’s time to plead when it is just to do so.6 Further, the statement of claim must show a case for the order the plaintiff seeks to obtain. Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2017 goes on to say: “...... it is not the practice of the court to make a declaration of right in default of defence, ...... but where such relief is to be granted without trial or eviden ce, the right course for the court is not to make a declaration but to state on what footing the relief is to be granted | (2) a declaration that the plaintiff ha s been in adverse possession of the Property for a period exceeding 12 years prior to the commencement of the action and has acquired an indefeasible possessory title to the Property; and | In about October 1978, the defendant, who is the widow of Leung Hung , came to reside in Hong Kong in the Property.

In summary, the plaintiff’ s case is that the defendant has failed to pay the monthly service fees on 1 February, 1 March, 1 April and 1 May 2018 totally USD80,000 under the contract. 5. The defendant does not deny this, but alleges that the non - payment was due to a breach of the express terms and condition of the contract by the plaintiff in that the plaintiff has failed to provide any marketing and/or marketing services during this period of time. The defendant ra ises a counterclaim for loss and damages to be assessed due to the breach of contract. 6. The plaintiff disputes this line of defence and produced various email correspondence between its director, Mr. James Patrick A | contractual relatio nships between the parties over the ye ars, and then he launched straight in to allegations of the plaintiff’ s various failures in some details and over some 11 pages. 24. And yet, when it came to the crucial issue regarding the share subscription set -off, Tim only dealt with it briefly: he claimed the plaintiff was “attempting to convolute the matter” because the service fee for shares “set-off proposal” did not materialis e and the shares allotment to Kelly was forfeited eventually. 25. This is cle arly not an explanation: indeed , Tim’s admission that the “set-off proposal” did not material ise was all the more significant because it also begs the same question: why, despite this, the defendant still withheld the serv ice fee without raising any allegations of failures of the plaintiff (which Tim could pr ovide in such details now) in all the A B C D E F G H I | / assertions raised in the defence: that is, the allegation of a breach of contract.

The plaintiff was driving private car MN4843 from Tsim Sha Tsui towards the direction of Tuen Mun along Lin Cheung Road, whereas the defendant was driving HM9689 immediately behind MN4843. The cars in front of MN4843 slowed down near a junctio n between two roads, and the plaintiff also slowed down his vehicle accordingly. The defendant failed to stop HM9689 in time, and it hit the rear of MN4843, causing damage to MN4843, which had been particularized in the Amended Statement of Claim as HK$95 ,000 repair cost, HK$900 cost of survey report and HK$23,250 rental of private car during period of repair from 14 October 2015 to 24 November 2015, totaling HK$119,150. The plaintiff also claims interest on the said sum and costs. Analysis 3. The action had been set down for assessment of damages pursuant to the Order of Registrar Lui on 19 September 2019.

However, the plaintiff did not do so until late November 2018. I appreciate that the plaintiff is a company in the US and they would certainly need some time to engage Hong Kon g lawyers to take care of the matter. However, even bearing this in mind, there is a time gap of more than 6 months between mid -April 2018 and late November 2018.

In both documents, the Authority required the same to be witnesse d and signed. In the Certification Form, the Authority also required the witness to certify the truth of the content s (“茲証明上述屋契 /牌照持有人及其 家人均為確 實無訛，特此証明 ”).

Firstly, on the face of the leaflet there is no express term of a promise on revenue or profit. Instead, at three different pages under the budget tables was a disclaimer stating that the information was for reference only and the provider of that inform ation accepted no liability for its accuracy or for any loss arising from it. Ms So, whilst agreeing that she sees the disclaimer at the three different pages when the leaflet is presented to her at trial, appears to suggest that she did not notice it at the meeting on 24 June 2015. I find this assertion to be unbelievable. It is not her case that she did not understand the disclaimer or Mr Tse had dishonestly added the disclaimer into the leaflet at some point in time after the meeting in June. Such a c ase has not been pleaded nor put by Mr Colin Leung to Mr Tse under cross examination. On the contrary, in her Amended Reply Ms So pleads that the disclaimer was represented by Mr Tse to be some standard advertising wordings and what was said by him orally at the meeting superseded the disclaimer. By necessary implication, Ms So must have noticed about the disclaimer in the leaflet as it was drawn to her attention when, so she says, Mr Tse asked her to ignore it. For the latter part, however, Mr Colin Leu ng has not specifically cross examined Mr Tse on the point in the manner as pleaded | Secondly, clause 2 of the letter of intent provides that the applicant understood, amongst other things, the risks of investment.

As a matter of fact, Ms So was at the time considering an investment into a new business. She was not looking to purchase an existing franchise education centre as Mr Tse describes to sometimes take place from time to time. In the meeting on 24 June 2015, Ms So met Mr Tse for the first time in person. It cannot be said that she knew either Mr Tse or the Thames Culture brand well. For her investment, nothing was certain such as the location of the centre, the market trend for a particular district, the availability of teaching staff, the curriculum offered by the centre and so on. Mr Tse then asked and Ms So estimated that she was able to afford a maximum loss of HK$ 1,000,000.

In such a situation the courts will, in my judgment, require clear and affirmative evidence that the trespasser, claiming that he has acquired possession, not only had the requisite intention to possess, but made A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S such intention clear to the world.

As a result of the fraud, the plaintiff has transferred sums (“the transfers”) to an account in the Bank of China (Hong Kong) ( “the account”) on or about 15 May 2018 and 30 May 2018. The total of the sums transferred is US $162,555. The defendant is the holder of the account. 3. In or about mid -June 2018, the plaintiff discovered the fraud and instructed a US law firm to handle the matter. In mid -July 2018, the US law firm reported the matter to the Hong Kong Police. 4. On or about 6 August 2018, amongst other things, the Hong Kong Police informed the plaintiff that: - (1) US$103,945.46 was found in the account; | I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to have the injunction sought in the summons.

    "case_type": "By my Decision dated 29 November 2023 ([2023] HKDC 1662), I ordered that, inter alia , the Master’s decision dated 27 February A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V 2023 be set aside, and the plaintiff’s summons dated 7 June 2022 to strike out the Amended Defence be dismissed with no order as to costs | The plaintiff now applies for leave to appeal against my Decision in relation to his striking out application. The principles on when leave ought to be granted are well known and not disputed, and do not need lengthy repetition here | Ground 6 complains that I should not have considered the 2nd Affirmation of Choi Wai Keung dated 28 August 2023 in refusing to strike out the Amended Defence, as the affirmation was filed to support the defendant’s summons to re -amend the Amended Defence, and was not available to the Master at the hearing below. It is argued that the affirmation does not satisfy the principles as laid d own in Ladd v Marshall , and thus should not be accepted as part of the evidence for the plaintiff’s striking out application before me | Ground 1 claims that, by summarizing what I understood to be the defendant’s case in §20 of the Decision, I must have proceeded on the basis that there was an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, sometime prior to the execution of the Assignments, that the plaintiff would assign the subject lands to the defendant at no consideration for the purpo se of giving effect to intention the defendant alleges to have existed (“the Alleged Agreement”). But I erred in not recognizing that (i) the Alleged Agreement has never been pleaded in the Amended Defence; (ii) it was so lacking in particulars such that it could not be believed at all; and (iii) it was in fact contradictory with the Amended Defence. As a result, my reasoning in finding that the defendant has pleaded an adequate defence is defective | I do not think the plaintiff has correctly characteriz ed §20 of the Decision. That paragraph alluded to my understanding that the defendant pleaded a mutual understanding as to who should be entitled to what land by the time of Chinese DFA and the DFA were entered into, such that the 2 documents should be co nstrued in consistent with such understanding. The alleged mutual understanding did not necessarily need to sound through a legally binding agreement in order to be given effect with through the interpretation of the Chinese DFA and the DFA",

As mentioned, the plaintiff never denied that it had knowledge about the return of the writ through post on or after 5 December 2019. Nor did it deny that such knowledge existed at the time when it applied for default judgment which was issu ed on 6 January 2020. In my judgment, the plaintiff could no t take advantage of the deemed service of the writ on the defendant for the purpose of applying for default judgment against the defendant at the relevant time , whether service was done pursuant to O10, r1 or section 827 of the CO . A | The defendant argues that the service of the writ on the defendant was bad and ineffective. It highlights the fact that the writ that was apparently sent by re gistered post to the registered office address of the defendant was somehow returned in post to the plaintiff’s solicitors on or about 5 December 2019 prior to the plaintiff’s obtaining the judgment (which was entered on 6 January 2020). This is substanti ated by Hongkong Post’s record of the delivery status of the mail. In terms of evidence, the plaintiff never denied that. However, it says this is irrelevant. 11. The plaintiff argues that the return of the posted writ to it is irrelevant, and did not affec t its entitlement to obtain the judgment. The basis is its distinction between service pursuant to O 10 of the Rules of the District Court, Cap 336H and that pursuant to section 827 of the Companies Ordinance, Cap 622 (“CO”). The plaintiff says that the writ in the present case was served pursuant to the latter | I do not agree with the plaintiff that section 827 of the CO has the effect contended, and O10, r1 certainly does not have such effect. The whole basis for entering judgment pursuant to O 13 is the defendant’s default, which must represent the state of affairs at the time when the plaintiff applies for such judgment. If in fact the writ has been returned through post to the plaintiff prior to his seeking judgment, the state of affairs, namely, the defendant ’s default , notwithstanding (deemed) service of the writ, does not exist, whether the writ has been served pursuant to O A B | By notice of appeal file d on 18 August 2020, the defendant appeals. Essentially, the defendant argues that the judgment was irregular in that there was no good service of the writ, and in any event it is liable to be set aside in its entirety on the merits",
