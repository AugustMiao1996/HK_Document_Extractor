The plaintiffs ’ case is that, the Sho p had been continuously affect ed by the water seepage problem s over the years from 2010 to 2017 . They are not confined to the periods stated in the nuisance notices only. The plaintiffs say the history of the seepage has clearly shown that the 1st floor was the source of the leakage as repeated nuisance notices had been issued against the defendant , targeted against different areas on the 1st floor. The plaintiffs further say that, given the history of the water leakage, the number of complaints and the number of nuisance notices received by them , the defendant ought to have engaged a competent contractor to make a complete overhaul of the drainage system on the 1st floor. Hence, the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had neglected in maintaining the 1st floor and left it in a state of disrepair. Such neglect , according to the plaintiffs, has caused distress, discomfort and inconvenience to the plaintiffs over a period of 8 years | (c) If the defendant neither knows and intends harm nor is negligent with regard to the consequences of his conduct, then he may be nevertheless liable if the claimant can bring his case within the rule in Rylands v Fletcher , and in that event there is strict liability.
